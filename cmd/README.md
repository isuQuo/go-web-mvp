# cmd

This directory contains the entry point for the web application.

## web

The `web` folder contains the main.go file, which is the main entry point of the web application. It initializes and starts the server, configures routes, and sets up any required middleware.

To run the application, navigate to the `web` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the web server and listen for incoming requests. You can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

Feel free to modify the main.go file to add new routes, middleware, or adjust the server configuration.
