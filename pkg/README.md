# pkg

The pkg directory contains reusable code and libraries that can be imported and used by other projects. This includes utility functions, custom middleware, and other common functionality that could be beneficial to multiple projects.

When creating a new package within this directory, ensure that it is:

- Well-documented
- Contains unit tests
- Has a clear and concise API
- This will make it easier for others to use and understand the purpose of the package.

Remember to use semantic versioning when versioning the packages in this directory, to make it easier for others to manage dependencies in their projects.
