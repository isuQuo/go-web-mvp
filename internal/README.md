# internal
The internal directory contains the application-specific code that is not intended to be reused by other projects. This code is organized into packages based on functionality.

Here you'll find packages related to:

- Database access and manipulation
- Business logic
- Data structures and models
- When adding new functionality to the application, create a new package within this directory and organize your code accordingly. This helps maintain a clean and modular architecture for the web application.

Feel free to use subdirectories within packages to further organize your code if necessary.
